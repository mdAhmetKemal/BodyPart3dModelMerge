merge tool for Anatomical part on the BodyParts3D  \n
I had developmed this tool for BodyParts3D model set in the 2013.  \n

This tool  can merge that wanted compened model in the "component_list.txt".  \n

how can you use this tool ?  \n
 1- put in this BodyPart3dModelMerge app and "component_list.txt" \n
      on the \BodyParts3D_3.0_obj_99 directorty  \n
 2- find component Id (ex. FMA24728)    that you  wanted component name  (face ) in the "component_list.txt" \n
 3 -write  component ID in application like  FMA24728  then press enter and wait for writing file. \n
 4 - file will have wroten that  name "component_name.obj" all merged sub component piece \n
